# ü¶Ö Operation Falcon Eye: Payment Fraud Under Surveillance

Welcome to **Operation Falcon Eye**, a data science challenge initiated by [SuperDataScience](https://www.superdatascience.com/?affiliate_code=89b6bb). This mission is designed for data scientists of all skill levels, with three different **Assignments** tailored to your expertise. Dive into the dataset, tackle the assignment that best matches your skills, and contribute to this collaborative project.

## üõ† How to Contribute

Please read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how to contribute.

## üìú Mission Brief
Your mission, agent, should you choose to accept it, is to design and deploy a Machine Learning system capable of detecting fraudulent online transactions. Leveraging a historical dataset that details various transaction behaviors, your objective is to identify and halt fraudulent payments before they strike.

By analyzing attributes such as transaction type, amount, and source/destination account balances, you will craft an efficient classification model for real-time fraud detection. Success in this mission will empower financial institutions and digital marketplaces to protect their customers and maintain trust in online transactions.

## üéØ Mission Objectives
1. **Data Ingestion & Exploration**
    - Ingest and explore the dataset featuring transaction time steps, amounts, account balances, and fraud indicators.
    - Understand key risk factors and patterns contributing to fraudulent payments.

2. **Feature Engineering & Model Development**
    - Engineer meaningful features (e.g., transaction velocity, balance changes) to enhance model accuracy.
    - Train multiple Machine Learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and evaluate their performance in fraud detection.

3. **Model Evaluation & Optimization**
    - Assess model effectiveness using classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC).
    - Optimize model parameters and address any imbalanced data through techniques such as SMOTE or undersampling.

4. **Deployment & Monitoring**
    - Deploy the best-performing model in a stable, production-like environment.

5. **Documentation & Reporting**
    - Document the entire pipeline, from data acquisition and preparation to model serving.

## üèÜ Assignments
### **Level 1: The Initiate**
**Requirements:**
- **Data Exploration & Basic Model**
    - Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, remove duplicates, etc.).
    - Explore important features like transaction _type_, _amount_, _oldbalanceOrg_, _newbalanceOrig_, _oldbalanceDest_, _newbalanceDest_, and label (_isFraud_).
    - Develop a simple baseline classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression or Decision Tree).

- **Metrics & Reporting**
    - Evaluate the baseline model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Summarize initial observations and limitations in a brief report.

**Technical Stack:**
- **Core Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Local or basic cloud-based notebook
- **Data Handling**: CSV ingestion from the Kaggle dataset
